# China-fishing-power
# This repository contains data and R code for estimating fishing power, catch, and CPUE (catch per unit fishing power per year) for China's marine fisheries and its three fishing 
# sectors: (i) industrial fisheris within China's four seas (C4S), (ii) small-scale fisheries, and (iii) distant-water fisheries beyond C4S.
# R codes: (i) CN_catchers_recon.R was used to reconstruct fishing power of catchers, (ii) the CN_c4s_catch.R was used to estimate catch from C4S, and (ii) Figures.R was used to
# create the figures for publication.
